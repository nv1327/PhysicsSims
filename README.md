# PhysicsSims
Physics Simulations including a modular piston with gear ratios, a Fourier Transform, and gravity stuff.

In order to try out the different simulations, make sure you change the Javascript source file in the HTML!. Change the "src" tag to the .js file you want to use.

You need to import p5.js into your project, though, since all of these files use p5.js. Alternatively, you can just use the javascript and run it on your computer through a local network or with Processing.
